# cs-210-project-two

This project takes user input and calculates interest over a fixed amount of time.

What did you do particularly well?
- I felt that I developed a well structured Object Oriented project. I really feel like I have a grasp on how to build classes and use them.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- I could enhance my code by incorporating better memory management.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- I found breaking the code up into header files to be a little confusing. I used a lot of YouTube tutorials for this project, and will continue to do so.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- The principals of object oriented programming can be carried over to other languages that use the paradigm.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I used comments and best practices (naming, whitespace, etc).
